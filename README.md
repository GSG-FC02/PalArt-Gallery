## The purpose of this website:
To display the importance of plastic art and shed light on Palestinian plastic artists.


## About this site :
t is a site for a team of illustrators to display the collection paintings that were painted by Palestinian artists.
Front page: The site begins by talking about this team, then displays the team of illustrators and their names, and some of their drawings in the form of pictures, and a mechanism for communicating with the site.
The second page provides more information about each painter and a group of paintings for each of them.

## The journey to completion

* We searched some previous design templates to gather some ideas.
* We sketched the design as a prototype.
* We have agreed on a specific design for the site.
* We have determined the colors that will be used from the color hunt website to choose consistent colors, then choose the type of font used from Google Fonts.
* We distributed the tasks to the team in an agreed manner.
* Continuous communication to follow up the tasks and ensure that there are any design problems
* Push design files on GitHub.
* To make sure that there are no errors and to follow up on each person's tasks constantly.
* Modify some of the errors that we encountered.
