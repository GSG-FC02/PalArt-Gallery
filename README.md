##The purpose of this website:
To display the importance of plastic art and shed light on Palestinian plastic artists.


##About this site :
t is a site for a team of illustrators to display the collection paintings that were painted by Palestinian artists.
Front page: The site begins by talking about this team, then displays the team of illustrators and their names, and some of their drawings in the form of pictures, and a mechanism for communicating with the site.
The second page provides more information about each painter and a group of paintings for each of them.
