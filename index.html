            He was born in Jerusalem in 1991 and graduated from An-Najah
            University after studying architecture. After his graduation, he
            directed to painting Palestinian architecture, especially religious
            places, in a free way.

            I was born in Jaffa. I loved drawing from a young age, but it was
            nothing but irregular colors in the eyes of those around me, so I
            left it, but when I had some difficulties in joining a university,
            so it was an opportunity for me to express our Palestinian cause

            Born in Gaza in 1985, he graduated from the Islamic University with
            a major in history. He loved drawing from a young age so after his
            graduation he sought to convey his message of hope and optimism that
            he derived from his patriotism and the world's picture from his own
            eyes just through his colors.

            Born in Beersheba in 1995, she discovered her talent in drawing in
            her last year of high school, so she decided to take drawing as a
            profession and did not follow a specific style in it, so all she
            cared about was that her paintings contain glimpses of Palestinian
            culture.
